on ubuntu: (tested on xubuntu 13.04):
1. First fetch all the git repos using git submodules (example you just cloned this repo)
	- REMEMBER: this assumes you have github setup in ~/.ssh/config (else you should edit .gitmodules with http links.. before cloning)
	make git
The following needs sudo previledges:
2. sudo ./oab-java6/oab-java6.sh (get the java packages setup)
3. make install_ubuntu_packages - if you get conflicts, these need to be resolved
4. make
If everything goes well, you can now use ./ncsvc-socs-wrapper/juniper-vpn-wrap.py

XXX NOTE: on xubuntu 13.10 ia32-libs and lib32asound2 is gone..
I could not figure out how to make that crap work.. so gave up.
